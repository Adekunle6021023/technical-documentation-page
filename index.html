                <p>This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is not intended as a tutorial.

                    While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English rather than formal
                    specifications for everything except syntax and lexical analysis. This should make the document more
                    understandable to the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were
                    coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, you might have to guess
                    things and in fact you would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the other
                    hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the
                    language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would like to see a more
                    formal definition of the language, maybe you could volunteer your time — or invent a cloning machine
                    :-).</p>
                <p>
                    <h1><b>Alternate Implementations</b></h1>
                    Though there is one Python implementation which is by far the most popular, there are some alternate
                    implementations which are of particular interest to different audiences.

                    Known implementations include:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>CPython</b><br>
                            This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written in C. New
                            language features generally appear here first.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Jython</b><br>
                            Python implemented in Java. This implementation can be used as a scripting language for Java
                            applications, or can be used to create applications using the Java class libraries. It is
                            also often used to create tests for Java libraries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Python for .NET</b><br>
                            This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a managed .NET
                            application and makes .NET libraries available.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>IronPython</b><br>
                            An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python implementation
                            that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. It was created by
                            Jim Hugunin,the original creator of Jython.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>PyPy</b><br>
                            An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports several advanced
                            features not found in other implementations like stackless support and a Just in Time
                            compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation with the language
                            itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python).

                <p>
                    The descriptions of lexical analysis and syntax use a modified BNF grammar notation. This uses the
                    following style of definition:
                </p>
                <p class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        name ::= lc_letter (lc_letter | "_")*<br>
                        lc_letter ::= "a"..."z"
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first line says that a name is an lc_letter followed by a sequence of zero or more
                            lc_letters and underscores. An lc_letter in turn is any of the single characters 'a' through
                            'z'. (This rule is actually adhered to for the names defined in lexical and grammar rules in
                            this document.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and ::=. A vertical bar
                            (|) is used to separate alternatives; it is the least binding operator in this notation. A
                            star (*) means zero or more repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (+) means
                            one or more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets ([ ]) means zero or one
                            occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional). The * and + operators bind as
                            tightly as possible; parentheses are used for grouping. Literal strings are enclosed in
                            quotes. White space is only meaningful to separate tokens. Rules are normally contained on a
                            single line; rules with many alternatives may be formatted alternatively with each line
                            after the first beginning with a vertical bar.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In lexical definitions (as the example above), two more conventions are used: Two literal
                            characters separated by three dots mean a choice of any single character in the given
                            (inclusive) range of ASCII characters. A phrase between angular brackets (<...>) gives an
                                informal description of the symbol defined; e.g., this could be used to describe the
                                notion of ‘control character’ if needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Even though the notation used is almost the same, there is a big difference between the
                            meaning of lexical and syntactic definitions: a lexical definition operates on the
                            individual characters of the input source, while a syntax definition operates on the stream
                            of tokens generated by the lexical analysis. All uses of BNF in the next chapter (“Lexical
                            Analysis”) are lexical definitions; uses in subsequent chapters are syntactic definitions.

                <p>
                    A Python program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, generated by the
                    lexical analyzer. This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens.

                    Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a source file can be given by an
                    encoding declaration and defaults to UTF-8, see PEP 3120 for details. If the source file cannot be
                    decoded, a SyntaxError is raised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Physical lines</b><br>
                    A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line sequence. In source files
                    and strings, any of the standard platform line termination sequences can be used - the Unix form
                    using ASCII LF (linefeed), the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by
                    linefeed), or the old Macintosh form using the ASCII CR (return) character. All of these forms can
                    be
                    used equally, regardless of platform. The end of input also serves as an implicit terminator for the
                    final physical line.

                    When embedding Python, source code strings should be passed to Python APIs using the standard C
                    conventions for newline characters (the \n character, representing ASCII LF, is the line
                    terminator).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Indentation</b><br>
                    Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the
                    indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.

                    Tabs are replaced (from left to right) by one to eight spaces such that the total number of
                    characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple of eight (this is intended to be the
                    same rule as used by Unix). The total number of spaces preceding the first non-blank character then
                    determines the line’s indentation. Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using
                    backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation.

                    Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that makes
                    the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in spaces; a TabError is raised in that case.

                    Cross-platform compatibility note: because of the nature of text editors on non-UNIX platforms, it
                    is unwise to use a mixture of spaces and tabs for the indentation in a single source file. It should
                    also be noted that different platforms may explicitly limit the maximum indentation level.

                    A formfeed character may be present at the start of the line; it will be ignored for the indentation
                    calculations above. Formfeed characters occurring elsewhere in the leading whitespace have an
                    undefined effect (for instance, they may reset the space count to zero).

                    The indentation levels of consecutive lines are used to generate INDENT and DEDENT tokens, using a
                    stack, as follows.

                    Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the stack; this will never be
                    popped off again. The numbers pushed on the stack will always be strictly increasing from bottom to
                    top. At the beginning of each logical line, the line’s indentation level is compared to the top of
                    the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger, it is pushed on the stack, and one
                    INDENT token is generated. If it is smaller, it must be one of the numbers occurring on the stack;
                    all numbers on the stack that are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT
                    token is generated. At the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each number remaining on
                    the stack that is larger than zero.

            <article>
                <p>
                    <b>Objects, values and types</b><br>
                    Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or
                    by relations between objects. (In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored
                    program computer”, code is also represented by objects.)

                    Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object’s identity never changes once it has
                    been created; you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. The ‘is’ operator compares the
                    identity of two objects; the id() function returns an integer representing its identity.

                    CPython implementation detail: For CPython, id(x) is the memory address where x is stored.

                    An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports (e.g., “does it have a length?”)
                    and also defines the possible values for objects of that type. The type() function returns an
                    object’s type (which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s type is also unchangeable.
                    1

                    The value of some objects can change. Objects whose value can change are said to be mutable; objects
                    whose value is unchangeable once they are created are called immutable. (The value of an immutable
                    container object that contains a reference to a mutable object can change when the latter’s value is
                    changed; however the container is still considered immutable, because the collection of objects it
                    contains cannot be changed. So, immutability is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable
                    value, it is more subtle.) An object’s mutability is determined by its type; for instance, numbers,
                    strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and lists are mutable.

                    Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become unreachable they may be
                    garbage-collected. An implementation is allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether
                    — it is a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is implemented, as long as no
                    objects are collected that are still reachable.

                    CPython implementation detail: CPython currently uses a reference-counting scheme with (optional)
                    delayed detection of cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they become
                    unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage containing circular references. See the
                    documentation of the gc module for information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage.
                    Other implementations act differently and CPython may change. Do not depend on immediate
                    finalization of objects when they become unreachable (so you should always close files explicitly).

                    Note that the use of the implementation’s tracing or debugging facilities may keep objects alive
                    that would normally be collectable. Also note that catching an exception with a ‘try…except’
                    statement may keep objects alive.

                    Some objects contain references to “external” resources such as open files or windows. It is
                    understood that these resources are freed when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage
                    collection is not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to release the
                    external resource, usually a close() method. Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close
                    such objects. The ‘try…finally’ statement and the ‘with’ statement provide convenient ways to do
                    this.

                    Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called containers. Examples of
                    containers are tuples, lists and dictionaries. The references are part of a container’s value. In
                    most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the values, not the identities of
                    the contained objects; however, when we talk about the mutability of a container, only the
                    identities of the immediately contained objects are implied. So, if an immutable container (like a
                    tuple) contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes if that mutable object is
                    changed.

                    Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior. Even the importance of object identity is
                    affected in some sense: for immutable types, operations that compute new values may actually return
                    a reference to any existing object with the same type and value, while for mutable objects this is
                    not allowed. E.g., after a = 1; b = 1, a and b may or may not refer to the same object with the
                    value one, depending on the implementation, but after c = []; d = [], c and d are guaranteed to
                    refer to two different, unique, newly created empty lists. (Note that c = d = [] assigns the same
                    object to both c and d.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Special method names</b><br>
                    A class can implement certain operations that are invoked by special syntax (such as arithmetic
                    operations or subscripting and slicing) by defining methods with special names. This is Python’s
                    approach to operator overloading, allowing classes to define their own behavior with respect to
                    language operators. For instance, if a class defines a method named __getitem__(), and x is an
                    instance of this class, then x[i] is roughly equivalent to type(x).__getitem__(x, i). Except where
                    mentioned, attempts to execute an operation raise an exception when no appropriate method is defined
                    (typically AttributeError or TypeError).

                    Setting a special method to None indicates that the corresponding operation is not available. For
                    example, if a class sets __iter__() to None, the class is not iterable, so calling iter() on its
                    instances will raise a TypeError (without falling back to __getitem__()). 2

                    When implementing a class that emulates any built-in type, it is important that the emulation only
                    be implemented to the degree that it makes sense for the object being modelled. For example, some
                    sequences may work well with retrieval of individual elements, but extracting a slice may not make
                    sense. (One example of this is the NodeList interface in the W3C’s Document Object Model.)

                    <b>Structure of a program</b><br>
                    A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A block is a piece of Python program text that is
                    executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition.
                    Each command typed interactively is a block. A script file (a file given as standard input to the
                    interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) is a code block. A script
                    command (a command specified on the interpreter command line with the -c option) is a code block. A
                    module run as a top level script (as module __main__) from the command line using a -m argument is
                    also a code block. The string argument passed to the built-in functions eval() and exec() is a code
                    block.

                    A code block is executed in an execution frame. A frame contains some administrative information
                    (used for debugging) and determines where and how execution continues after the code block’s
                    execution has completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Resolution of names</b><br>
                    A scope defines the visibility of a name within a block. If a local variable is defined in a block,
                    its scope includes that block. If the definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to
                    any blocks contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces a different
                    binding for the name.

                    When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest enclosing scope. The set of
                    all such scopes visible to a code block is called the block’s environment.

                    When a name is not found at all, a NameError exception is raised. If the current scope is a function
                    scope, and the name refers to a local variable that has not yet been bound to a value at the point
                    where the name is used, an UnboundLocalError exception is raised. UnboundLocalError is a subclass of
                    NameError.

                    If a name binding operation occurs anywhere within a code block, all uses of the name within the
                    block are treated as references to the current block. This can lead to errors when a name is used
                    within a block before it is bound. This rule is subtle. Python lacks declarations and allows name
                    binding operations to occur anywhere within a code block. The local variables of a code block can be
                    determined by scanning the entire text of the block for name binding operations.

                    If the global statement occurs within a block, all uses of the name specified in the statement refer
                    to the binding of that name in the top-level namespace. Names are resolved in the top-level
                    namespace by searching the global namespace, i.e. the namespace of the module containing the code
                    block, and the builtins namespace, the namespace of the module builtins. The global namespace is
                    searched first. If the name is not found there, the builtins namespace is searched. The global
                    statement must precede all uses of the name.

                    The global statement has the same scope as a name binding operation in the same block. If the
                    nearest enclosing scope for a free variable contains a global statement, the free variable is
                    treated as a global.

                    The nonlocal statement causes corresponding names to refer to previously bound variables in the
                    nearest enclosing function scope. SyntaxError is raised at compile time if the given name does not
                    exist in any enclosing function scope.

                    The namespace for a module is automatically created the first time a module is imported. The main
                    module for a script is always called __main__.

                    Class definition blocks and arguments to exec() and eval() are special in the context of name
                    resolution. A class definition is an executable statement that may use and define names. These
                    references follow the normal rules for name resolution with an exception that unbound local
                    variables are looked up in the global namespace. The namespace of the class definition becomes the
                    attribute dictionary of the class. The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the
                    class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods – this includes comprehensions and
                    generator expressions since they are implemented using a function scope. This means that the
                    following will fail:
                    <p class="code-block">
                        <code>
                            class A: <br>
                            a = 42<br>
                            b = list(a + i for i in range(10))
                        </code>
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Interaction with dynamic features</b><br>
                    Name resolution of free variables occurs at runtime, not at compile time. This means that the
                    following code will print 42:
                    <p class="code-block">
                        <code>
                            i = 10<br>
                            def f():<br>
                            print(i)<br>
                            i = 42<br>
                            f()
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The eval() and exec() functions do not have access to the full environment for resolving names.
                        Names may be resolved in the local and global namespaces of the caller. Free variables are not
                        resolved in the nearest enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace. 1 The exec() and
                        eval()
                        functions have optional arguments to override the global and local namespace. If only one
                        namespace
                        is specified, it is used for both.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Exceptions</b><br>
                    Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code block in order to
                    handle errors or other exceptional conditions. An exception is raised at the point where the error
                    is detected; it may be handled by the surrounding code block or by any code block that directly or
                    indirectly invoked the code block where the error occurred.

                    The Python interpreter raises an exception when it detects a run-time error (such as division by
                    zero). A Python program can also explicitly raise an exception with the raise statement. Exception
                    handlers are specified with the try … except statement. The finally clause of such a statement can
                    be used to specify cleanup code which does not handle the exception, but is executed whether an
                    exception occurred or not in the preceding code.

                    Python uses the “termination” model of error handling: an exception handler can find out what
                    happened and continue execution at an outer level, but it cannot repair the cause of the error and
                    retry the failing operation (except by re-entering the offending piece of code from the top).

                    When an exception is not handled at all, the interpreter terminates execution of the program, or
                    returns to its interactive main loop. In either case, it prints a stack traceback, except when the
                    exception is SystemExit.

                    Exceptions are identified by class instances. The except clause is selected depending on the class
                    of the instance: it must reference the class of the instance or a base class thereof. The instance
                    can be received by the handler and can carry additional information about the exceptional condition.

                <p>
                    Python code in one module gains access to the code in another module by the process of importing it.
                    The import statement is the most common way of invoking the import machinery, but it is not the only
                    way. Functions such as importlib.import_module() and built-in __import__() can also be used to
                    invoke the import machinery.

                    The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the
                    results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the import statement is
                    defined as a call to the __import__() function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of
                    __import__() is used to perform the name binding operation of the import statement. See the import
                    statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.

                    A direct call to __import__() performs only the module search and, if found, the module creation
                    operation. While certain side-effects may occur, such as the importing of parent packages, and the
                    updating of various caches (including sys.modules), only the import statement performs a name
                    binding operation.

                    When an import statement is executed, the standard builtin __import__() function is called. Other
                    mechanisms for invoking the import system (such as importlib.import_module()) may choose to bypass
                    __import__() and use their own solutions to implement import semantics.

                    <b>Packages</b><br>
                    Python has only one type of module object, and all modules are of this type, regardless of whether
                    the module is implemented in Python, C, or something else. To help organize modules and provide a
                    naming hierarchy, Python has a concept of packages.

                    You can think of packages as the directories on a file system and modules as files within
                    directories, but don’t take this analogy too literally since packages and modules need not originate
                    from the file system. For the purposes of this documentation, we’ll use this convenient analogy of
                    directories and files. Like file system directories, packages are organized hierarchically, and
                    packages may themselves contain subpackages, as well as regular modules.

                    It’s important to keep in mind that all packages are modules, but not all modules are packages. Or
                    put another way, packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains
                    a __path__ attribute is considered a package.

                    All modules have a name. Subpackage names are separated from their parent package name by a dot,
                    akin to Python’s standard attribute access syntax. Thus you might have a module called sys and a
                    package called email, which in turn has a subpackage called email.mime and a module within that
                    subpackage called email.mime.text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Regular packages</b><br>
                    Python defines two types of packages, regular packages and namespace packages. Regular packages are
                    traditional packages as they existed in Python 3.2 and earlier. A regular package is typically
                    implemented as a directory containing an __init__.py file. When a regular package is imported, this
                    __init__.py file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are bound to names in the
                    package’s namespace. The __init__.py file can contain the same Python code that any other module can
                    contain, and Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.

                    For example, the following file system layout defines a top level parent package with three
                    subpackages:
                    <p class="code-block">

                            one/<br>
                            __init__.py<br>
                            two/<br>
                            __init__.py<br>
                            three/<br>
                            __init__.py
                        </code>
